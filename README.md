# Learning Resources for TL-Verilog

Numerous trainings, videos, papers, and posts can be found on the [Redwood EDA Publications](https://www.redwoodeda.com/publications) page.

The [Makerchip.com](https://www.makerchip.com) IDE contains tutorials for learning TL-Verilog.

TL-Verilog is an evolving language with evolving tools and infrastructure. Several important features are actively being explored and documentation for these is limited:

  - M4 macro preprocessing is being used to explore parameterization and code generation in TL-Verilog before proper TL-Verilog features are defined. [M4 docs](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/m4/manual/m4-1.4.18/index.html) are available, but the particular use of M4 with TL-Verilog is considered transitional, and is currently undocumented.
